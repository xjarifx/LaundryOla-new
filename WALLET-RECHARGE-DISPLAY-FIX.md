# Wallet Recharge Display Issue Fix

## Problem

When customers add money to their wallet (e.g., â‚¹4000), the transaction history showed "-â‚¹4000" instead of "+â‚¹4000", making it appear as if money was being deducted instead of added.

## Root Causes Identified

### 1. Missing Database View

- Backend was querying `view_wallet_transactions` which didn't exist in the database
- This was causing the transactions API to fail or return incorrect data

### 2. Transaction Type Mapping Issue

- Database stores transaction types as: `"Add Money"` and `"Payment"`
- Frontend expected transaction types as: `"CREDIT"` and `"DEBIT"`
- No mapping existed between database values and frontend expectations

### 3. Amount Display Logic Issue

- Frontend wasn't using `Math.abs()` to ensure positive display of amounts
- Relied on manual +/- sign addition but didn't handle negative stored amounts properly

## Solutions Applied

### 1. Created Missing Database View (`view_wallet_transactions`)

```sql
CREATE VIEW view_wallet_transactions AS
SELECT
    wt.transaction_id,
    wt.customer_id,
    wt.amount,
    wt.transaction_type,
    wt.transaction_date as created_at,
    wt.order_id,
    -- Map transaction_type to frontend expected values
    CASE
        WHEN wt.transaction_type = 'Add Money' THEN 'CREDIT'
        WHEN wt.transaction_type = 'Payment' THEN 'DEBIT'
        ELSE wt.transaction_type
    END as type,
    -- Add description field
    CASE
        WHEN wt.transaction_type = 'Add Money' THEN 'Wallet top-up'
        WHEN wt.transaction_type = 'Payment' THEN CONCAT('Order payment - Order #', wt.order_id)
        ELSE 'Transaction'
    END as description
FROM Wallet_Transactions wt
ORDER BY wt.transaction_date DESC;
```

### 2. Fixed Frontend Display Logic (`CustomerWallet.jsx`)

```javascript
// BEFORE: Could show negative amounts incorrectly
â‚¹{transaction.amount}

// AFTER: Always shows absolute value with correct sign
â‚¹{Math.abs(parseFloat(transaction.amount)).toFixed(2)}
```

### 3. Improved API Response Handling

- Added console logging for debugging API responses
- Better handling of different API response structures
- Fallback logic for data extraction

## Test Results

âœ… **Database View Working**: Maps transaction types correctly:

- "Add Money" â†’ "CREDIT"
- "Payment" â†’ "DEBIT"

âœ… **Transaction Display Fixed**:

- Add Money: Shows `+â‚¹100.00` (was showing `-â‚¹100.00`)
- Payments: Shows `-â‚¹30.00` (correct)

âœ… **API Integration Working**: Backend can now successfully query wallet transactions

## Files Modified

1. **Database**: Created `view_wallet_transactions` view
2. **Frontend**: `client/src/pages/customer/CustomerWallet.jsx` - Fixed display logic
3. **Testing**: Created verification scripts

## Expected Behavior After Fix

1. **Add Money â‚¹4000** â†’ Shows as **"+â‚¹4000.00"** âœ…
2. **Order Payment â‚¹50** â†’ Shows as **"-â‚¹50.00"** âœ…
3. **Transaction History** â†’ Loads correctly without API errors âœ…
4. **Transaction Descriptions** â†’ Clear and informative âœ…

## Prevention

- Database views are now properly documented
- Frontend display logic uses Math.abs() for robust amount handling
- API response structure is validated with fallbacks

The wallet recharge display issue has been completely resolved! ðŸŽ‰
